# API Management Policy

This sample demonstrates how to consume a standalone API Management policy XML file with a convention.
Once consumed by the convention, rules can be used to validate the policy.

## Usage

- Include the `APIManagementPolicy.Import` convention.
- Store policy XML files in the `policies/` subdirectory.
